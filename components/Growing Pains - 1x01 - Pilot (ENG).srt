1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:04,159
<i>Hi, I'm Jason Seaver. I'm a psychiatrist.</i>

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:07,229
<i>I've spent the last 15 years helping people</i>
<i>with their problems.</i>

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:08,672
<i>And I'm Maggie Seaver.</i>

4
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,937
<i>I've spent the last 15 years</i>
<i>helping our kids...</i>

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,309
<i>with problems</i>
<i>even Jason wouldn't believe.</i>

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,146
<i>Now Maggie has gone back to work</i>
<i>as a reporter for the local newspaper.</i>

7
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,185
<i>And Jason has moved his practice</i>
<i>into the house...</i>

8
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,514
<i>so he could be there for the kids.</i>

9
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,817
<i>- They're great kids.</i>
<i>- Most of the time.</i>

10
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,254
<i>And the rest of the time...</i>

11
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,116
<i>- You'll love them anyway.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

12
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:28,720
Unbelievable.

13
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:26,073
All right, lady, drop that spatula
or you're scrambled.

14
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,921
Go ahead. Make my day.

15
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,219
Well...

16
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,629
I guess I showed you.

17
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,368
Show me more.

18
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,562
Jason, the kids.

19
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,232
I can kiss the kids later.

20
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:54,378
You know, I read an article
that said that two-career couples...

21
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,178
should really make special effort
to always remain...

22
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,145
frisky.

23
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,522
At breakfast?

24
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,490
At all meals.

25
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,696
What's the matter,
you guys aren't getting enough?

26
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,692
Mike, a lot of kids would get smacked
for a remark like that.

27
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,000
Come on, Dad, you can't hit me.
You're a liberal humanist.

28
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,231
Could be an accident.

29
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,410
It could be a dream come true.

30
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,770
Mom, can't we sell Carol
and get a tape deck for the Volvo?

31
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,578
Mike, you give new meaning
to the word "vacuous."

32
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,246
Oh, yeah? What was the old meaning?

33
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,714
I rest my case.

34
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,318
Ben. Ben.

35
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,629
What's so funny, Ben?

36
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,368
That Phyllis George!
She screwed up again!

37
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,065
Honey, what's that you're reading about?

38
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,077
It says here that as the universe expands...

39
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:04,139
all matter is slowly degenerating
into a state of total disorganization.

40
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,416
Thank God. I thought it was just me.

41
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,785
Yeah, so, what are you guys
doing tonight?

42
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,960
The House of Sweat? Yeah, great!

43
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,258
Hey, look, can I talk to you guys later?
Yeah. Bye.

44
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,006
Mike, what is "The House of Sweat"?

45
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,867
Well... It's, you know...

46
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,479
It's that new under-20 dance club
on Jericho Turnpike.

47
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,404
Yeah, and it sounds like a great idea,
Mom.

48
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,976
It's a safe, wholesome place
for teens to congregate.

49
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,014
And the larger the group,
the smaller their brains get.

50
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,486
Come on, Maggie...

51
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,618
Yeah, come on, Maggie.

52
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,128
Yes.
Well, time to go wait for that school bus.

53
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,999
You know, if I hurry, I can still
get a seat in the non-smoking section.

54
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,538
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Mom.

55
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,903
Bye, Ben. I love you.

56
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,202
Later, Ben.

57
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,876
I still have some paperwork to do
before my 9:00 gets here.

58
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:18,746
And if you start feeling frisky and you have
eight or 10 seconds before work...

59
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,122
you know where to find me.

60
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,563
Ben, what are you doing here?
You'll miss the bus.

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,301
What's the matter, honey?

62
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,741
Dad didn't know how to do my elbow.

63
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,437
Let me see.

64
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:48,977
Dad did a great job on this cut.
Superman Band-Aids, the works.

65
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,390
I get it. He didn't kiss it.

66
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,954
And say, "I love you, little pumpkin head."

67
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,500
It was all so clinical.

68
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,433
Mom, how come you had to go
back to work?

69
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,275
I didn't have to, Ben. I wanted to.

70
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,213
Come here.

71
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,315
Ben, imagine you had to spend...

72
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,585
15 years in this house
without ever going out to play.

73
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,125
You'd go crazy, wouldn't you?

74
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,858
Well, believe it or not, a lot of grown-ups
feel the same way about work.

75
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,793
That's sick, Mom.

76
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,663
Ben, I know this has been a big change
for all of us.

77
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:44,567
And I worry about not being here for you,
because, well, you're the youngest.

78
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,411
And I worry about
not being here for Carol...

79
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,108
because she's a girl
and she needs her mother.

80
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,481
And I worry about
not being here for Mike...

81
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,419
to keep him
from accidentally blowing something up.

82
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,780
And, believe me,
I worry about leaving your father here...

83
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,951
to cope with all you monsters.

84
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,695
You shouldn't worry so much, Mom.
You'll make yourself crazy.

85
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,699
I love you, little pumpkin head.

86
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,768
It's always the same dream, Doc.

87
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:23,415
I'm on a subway
and this woman sits across from me.

88
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,474
This beautiful woman.

89
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,612
And I look at her. She looks at me.

90
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,950
I lick my lips.

91
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,388
She licks her lips.

92
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,593
This goes on.

93
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,993
Then, finally, she leans across,
and she whispers to me:

94
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:49,638
"You have huge knees."

95
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,879
Does that mean anything, Doc?

96
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,118
That should be good for about $5 apiece.

97
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,617
Good visit, Walter.

98
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,561
And don't worry too much
about this thing. Okay?

99
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,840
See you next week. Bye-bye.

100
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,806
- Could I talk to you for a second, Dad?
- Sure.

101
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,382
- In your office.
- Sure.

102
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,355
- Kids.
- Me?

103
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:47,421
Yeah.

104
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,038
So you wanted to talk about something?

105
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,664
Yeah.

106
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:59,776
Mostly I just wanted to mention
how smoothly things have been running...

107
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,370
since the wife went back to work and
you moved your practice into the house.

108
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,814
Well, thank you.

109
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:08,711
Dad, we've been friends now
for a long time, right?

110
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,448
Off and on, yeah.

111
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,548
"Off and on." I love that.

112
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,719
See, Dad, you know that dance hall place
that I mentioned this morning?

113
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:17,990
The House of Sweat?

114
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,053
Yeah.

115
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,126
Jerry and I were talking and we decided...

116
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,259
Jerry?

117
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,426
Yeah, Jerry Dellish.

118
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,870
He's an older friend of mine.
Excellent driver...

119
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,601
with two years of driver's ed.

120
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,575
Two years of driver's ed?

121
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,603
Yeah.
See, in his first class he ran over a dog.

122
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,309
But he drove beautifully after that.

123
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:41,979
We're talking about
one tiny, reckless little dog here, Dad.

124
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,882
- Tough break.
- Yeah.

125
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,223
So, anyway, I was thinking that maybe
we could go down there tonight.

126
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,817
Jerry would drive
so you wouldn't have to do...

127
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,726
What would your mother say?

128
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,186
Mom?

129
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,565
I guess she would say...

130
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,603
What's the phrase I'm looking for here,
Dad?

131
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,572
- "No"?
- Yeah, that's it.

132
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,936
I guess that means I can't go, right?

133
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,270
Well, it just means
I don't like you coming in here...

134
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,610
and trying to get away with something.

135
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,583
That's not the relationship
I want to have with you.

136
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,282
I'm sorry, Dad.

137
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,119
All right, now, look.

138
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,055
Now that I'm in charge at home,
we can try things my way.

139
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,422
All right!

140
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,755
You don't even know what my way is.

141
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,127
Sure I do, Dad. It's a Sinatra song.

142
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,465
You're walking a fine line here, Mike.

143
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,101
Okay, look, here's the deal.

144
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,401
I'll give you a little more freedom.

145
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,342
You've got to promise me
a lot more responsibility.

146
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,075
Hey, no problem, Dad.
I swear, I am ready for total responsibility.

147
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,451
Mike, I'm not ready for total responsibility.

148
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,111
You're right. Sorry.

149
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,815
Okay. You go out and have a good time.

150
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,848
Just remember what we talked about.

151
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,052
Absolutely, Dad! Thanks, I promise.

152
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,862
Wait. What about Mom?
What if she's mad?

153
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,892
Mike, your mom's not an ogre.
I'll talk to her. She'll understand.

154
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,034
You let him do what?

155
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,701
Maggie, he's 15 years old now.

156
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,504
So he's 15.

157
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,011
It's completely arbitrary...

158
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,708
to just pick an age like that
and say that's when a kid is mature.

159
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,343
You know, by the time Mozart was 15,
he'd written seven symphonies.

160
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:24,287
That's because Mozart's father
didn't let him go to The House of Sweat.

161
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,860
Who did he go with?

162
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,761
I don't know, some kid.
Jerry Dillish, Dellish.

163
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,561
Jerry "Dog-Killer" Dellish?

164
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,638
Maggie, he hit one dog.

165
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,898
Yeah, but he hit it four times.

166
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,774
Okay, well...

167
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,608
Mike isn't Jerry.

168
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,084
And a kid needs some freedom
in order to learn responsibility.

169
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,282
Jason, I know you believe
in this "unlimited human potential"...

170
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,582
stuff.

171
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,687
And that's great for your patients.

172
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,593
- But when it comes...
- To our own children...

173
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,564
...I believe in original...
- Sin.

174
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:07,690
Sin.

175
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,769
I don't know.
Maybe I shouldn't have gone back to work.

176
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,033
Now, come on, Maggie, don't say that.

177
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:20,110
You took 15 years off to raise a family,
and you deserve to go back to work now.

178
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,880
You just have to have
a little more faith in me and the kids.

179
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,675
Maybe you're right.

180
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,477
Of course I'm right.

181
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:33,519
We shouldn't be worrying,
we should be celebrating...

182
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,494
which is why I've taken the liberty
of placing some chilled champagne...

183
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,725
in a little bucket beside the bed.

184
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,330
Slipped some satin sheets
on the old bouncer.

185
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,201
Satin sheets? You?

186
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,599
Yeah.

187
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:53,304
The guy in the store showed me
some "before" and "after" pictures...

188
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,176
of a couple who tried them.

189
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,943
They looked very satisfied.

190
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,678
What about Ben and Carol?

191
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,888
Well, I slipped some sleeping pills
into their Gatorade.

192
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,087
They'll be asleep for about three weeks.

193
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,219
Jason!

194
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:14,892
Well, I didn't really.
But they are... And we can...

195
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,540
Hello? Yeah, this is Jason Seaver.

196
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:28,076
No, you must be looking for someone else.
Take your clothes off.

197
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,915
No, our Mike is only 15,
so he wouldn't be driving a car.

198
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,281
I see.

199
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,655
What did he say?

200
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,424
He said,
"That's why your Mike is in our jail."

201
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,980
What are you in for, kid?

202
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,244
I...

203
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,680
I killed a man just to watch him die.

204
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,083
You?

205
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,360
Unpaid parking tickets.

206
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,926
Oh, no, it's my mom!

207
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,996
Come on, Maggie,
we don't even know the facts yet.

208
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,668
I mean,
it's not so unusual for a teenage boy...

209
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,103
to have a minor run-in with the police.

210
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,473
Some of these guys
can be real macho head-bangers.

211
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,976
Hiya, you folks care for some hot cocoa?
I just made a fresh pot.

212
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,046
Look, we're the Seavers.
You've locked up our son.

213
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,785
An officer claimed he was driving a car.

214
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,380
Yes, sir.

215
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,515
We picked him up
in The House of Sweat parking lot.

216
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:50,028
He'd been driving in circles
for approximately 12 minutes.

217
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:55,456
Okay, so a 15-year-old boy drives
his friend's car around the lot a few times.

218
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,499
Did I mention he sideswiped
a police car on the way out?

219
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,697
He what?

220
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,799
He tore that bumper off
like he was peeling an orange.

221
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,604
A $350 orange.

222
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,817
Hiya, Dad, Mom. You look good tonight.

223
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,354
You look young.

224
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,521
Come on, son.

225
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,332
Mom, Dad, this is Jerry.

226
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,370
I guess it's kind of hard
to see the basis of our friendship, huh?

227
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,509
I don't know.
He has a certain carefree charm.

228
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,344
You should see him when he's sober.

229
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,249
Mike, you will be grounded
for two months.

230
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,283
Two months?

231
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,380
- Dad, can't you talk to her?
- Oh, I did, Mike.

232
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,725
Originally, it was one month.

233
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,487
Dad, that means you added a month.

234
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,792
Nothing gets by you, does it?

235
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,299
Dad, you said you'd talk to her...

236
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,063
Damn it, Mike,
you said you could act responsibly!

237
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,697
Now I don't want to hear
another word out of you! Is that clear?

238
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,122
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

239
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,476
Oh, yeah, our romantic evening.

240
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,512
Anyone who's not used to satin sheets
could easily have an accident...

241
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,848
Maggie, don't patronize me. Okay?

242
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,750
And where the hell are my pajamas?

243
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,486
Gee, I'm sorry. I'm really not sure.

244
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,429
You wouldn't think
it'd be so damn tough to keep tabs...

245
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,432
on a pair of pajamas around here.

246
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,128
Jason, I don't understand
why you're so upset.

247
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:14,070
I mean, it's not like this is the first time
he's screwed up.

248
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,504
Who screwed up?

249
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,766
Mike.

250
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:20,878
Who said anything about Mike?
I'm upset because I can't find my pajamas.

251
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,948
I mean, if you just left
a pair of pajamas around...

252
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,916
and these are big pajamas
I'm talking about...

253
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,580
And to think that they
just vanished into thin air...

254
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,953
Well, wouldn't you be pretty upset?

255
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:37,987
Absolutely. In fact, I'm amazed at the way
you're holding together.

256
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,464
What?

257
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,869
I've never seen Dad
actually too mad to talk.

258
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,182
Thanks for your support.
You know, I feel like a new man now.

259
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,649
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,147
Look, it's not so bad.

261
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,956
I bet, in a year, he'll look back
at this whole thing and laugh.

262
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,858
Okay, maybe chuckle.

263
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,161
Okay, I admit it.

264
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,697
I'm upset with Mike.

265
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,300
Oh?

266
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,074
Aren't you?

267
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,411
Absolutely. I'm furious.

268
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,517
But no more furious than I've been at him
a dozen other times before.

269
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:39,052
I mean, he's a kid, Jason.
What did you expect?

270
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,224
Yeah, but he sat not 3 feet away from me
and he said:

271
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,320
"Dad, I swear it,
I'm ready for total responsibility."

272
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:50,631
Jason, you are not ready
for total responsibility.

273
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,134
I mean, face it, the boy is 15.

274
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,666
He's a hormone with feet.

275
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:04,614
I know, but someday
that hormone will be a man.

276
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,610
And I want that man to have
a sense of responsibility.

277
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,912
Go talk to him.

278
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,093
You won't sleep if you don't.

279
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:21,322
Don't worry.
I'll continue the search for the pajamas.

280
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,975
What?

281
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,821
You were asleep.

282
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,050
I was? I was.

283
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,524
And it was a dream.

284
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,599
You're still angry?

285
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:04,636
Hey, Dad, I know this is no excuse,
but Jerry's car handles really badly.

286
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,844
And I was the one who decided
Jerry was too drunk to drive.

287
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,179
Mike, he was unconscious.

288
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:16,943
I know.

289
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,023
What are you doing
with a kid who drinks like that?

290
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,125
I should've called you.

291
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,491
Why didn't you?

292
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,025
Well, Dad, there was these girls there...

293
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,968
Of course. Wouldn't want them
to think you had parents.

294
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:38,369
Mike, what kind of a relationship
are we going to have if I can't trust you?

295
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:43,537
I don't know. I guess I'm just a jerk.
Maybe you shouldn't trust me.

296
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,375
That's certainly one way to go.

297
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,953
That's the way my father went with me.

298
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,547
I guess I hoped that when I had a son
it would be different.

299
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,893
I know, Dad.

300
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,798
Mike, you probably don't remember this,
but...

301
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,291
when you were 3 weeks old...

302
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,201
I took you to the Mets home opener.

303
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,941
Cradled you in my arms.

304
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,713
Up comes Donn Clendenon.

305
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,113
Hits a shot off the left-field scoreboard
to win it in the 12th.

306
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,583
I hugged you real tight...

307
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,747
jumping up and down.

308
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,984
And you...

309
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,389
you threw up in your complimentary
Mets batting helmet.

310
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,297
I'm sorry, Dad.

311
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,435
It was my fault.

312
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,198
I never should've let you
suck that beer off my finger.

313
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,877
No, Dad, I meant about tonight. I'm sorry.

314
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,584
Well, thank you.

315
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,681
You know, Dad, I try. I really try.

316
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,920
But sometimes...

317
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,954
almost without warning, I just find myself
doing something really stupid.

318
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,800
Sort of an uncontrollable impulse?

319
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:11,992
Yeah.

320
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,668
Or is it more like you think
you're doing something really stupid...

321
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,436
and then you weigh your chances
of getting away with it...

322
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,411
and if they're better than 10%,
you go for it.

323
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,504
Yeah!

324
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,879
That's why you're grounded
for two months.

325
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,309
Yeah.

326
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:33,423
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I did some pretty lame-o things in my day.

327
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,486
- You?
- Yeah.

328
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,058
Like what?

329
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,754
Like I remember when I was 16...

330
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,628
me and some buddies,
we drove around town one night...

331
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,099
mooning everybody.

332
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,028
We even mooned the mayor's wife.

333
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,568
You, Dad?

334
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,243
Yeah, we got arrested
for indecent exposure.

335
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,540
Had to let us off though.

336
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,276
Mayor's wife refused
to make an identification.

337
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,450
- You, Dad?
- Will you stop saying that?

338
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,785
Does Mom know about this?

339
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,224
Are you kidding?

340
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,056
How do you think we met?

341
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,297
All right, Dad.

342
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,561
Hey, Dad, do you ever get the urge
to do dumb stuff now?
